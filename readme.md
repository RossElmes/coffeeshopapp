### Project Overview
My friend owns a busy coffee shop in Carlow town.  He has a small presence online, mostly on social media.  He has a website but doesn’t really want to explore this option any further.  One of his main bug bearers is at busier times wait time for people can be longer due to the demand of people coming into the shop.  He hates to see regular customers walking away because a que is too long. I asked him about a Just Eat style application where customer can select a time to preorder their coffee so that it’s ready for collection when they arrive.  He doesn’t mind about paying online yet but think this is a great idea.  If it could integrate into his current till system he said he’d be interested.  This is the basis of my project.
